Hi there. My name is [Kazuyoshi Kato](https://8-p.info/me/).
I'm a Japanese software developer in Seattle, Washington.

I mainly write short "what I learned recently" stuff here. Most of them are computer-related.

I'm participating [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/) since May 2020.
