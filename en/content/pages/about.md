Hi there. My name is [Kazuyoshi Kato](https://8-p.info/me/).
I'm a Japanese software developer in Seattle, Washington.

I mainly write short "what I learned recently" stuff here. Most of them are computer-related.

I was participating [100 Days To Offload](https://100daystooffload.com/) from [May 2020 to February 2021](https://blog.8-p.info/en/2021/02/12/100th/).
