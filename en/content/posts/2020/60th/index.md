This is the 60th post of my #100DaysToOffload challenge. I was fast this time.

### More Pictures?

No. I think I took pictures more than before, but most of them are about my family, which I don't want to share here.

In addition to that, I like to take pictures under natural light, but I mainly work at that time. While software development doesn't need sunlight much compared to photography, I work while others are virtually, time-wise around.

### Post-Offload

What would I do on this blog after the challenge? I may slow down, but I know that I cannot simply say I'm going to prioritize quality over quantity. It would result dead-end.

Limiting the question to "this blog" doesn't make much sense. What would I do on the internet, or well... my life?

This really sounds like a mid-life crisis though.
