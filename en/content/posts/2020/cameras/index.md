### Sony RX-100 IV

In [August 2017](https://blog.8-p.info/ja/2017/09/25/q3/), right before a family trip to Mexico, I bought this camera at the used section of Glazer's Camera in Seattle. This is my primary camera these days due to its portability.

I've just attached the Nikon strap yesterday, to use the camera more often.

### Nikon D3100

Before the RX-100, I was using Nikon D3100 primarily. I bought this camera in [2010](https://blog.8-p.info/2010/48-4q). I was still in Japan at that time. The additional lens on the picture above is AF-S DX Nikkor 35mm f/1.8G.

While it is bulky, I still like the camera. Or I would say that the bulkiness is the feature because it fits my hands well than smaller cameras.
