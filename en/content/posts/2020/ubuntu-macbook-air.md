I have installed Ubuntu on MacBook Air in... August? It was a long time ago.

Surprisingly it works mostly flawlessly. Even all proprietary keyboard buttons (Keyboard Backlight, Volume Up, Volume Down, ...) works out of the box.

There are a few things I don't like about;

- Keybinding: I'm used to macOS's keybinding which uses Cmd for GUI/macOS stuff such as Cmd-x for Cut, and Ctrl for Unix/Emacs stuff such as Ctrl-a for moving a cursor to the beginning of a line.
- Battery: It seems shorter than macOS.
- Display: This MacBook Air simply doesn't have an Retina display.

So I still use my 2017 MacBook Pro as my daily driver.
