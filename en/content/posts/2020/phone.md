I was looking [I’m happier without a smartphone](https://variousbits.net/2018/05/11/im-happier-without-a-smartphone/) (2018) from Firefox's History. I recently found this post and I liked it.

Getting rid of a smartphone is not for me, but I've been following basically what [Jake Knapp wrote](https://maketime.blog/article/six-years-with-a-distraction-free-iphone/) on the "Make Time" book.

> For me, an iPhone without distracting apps is an amazing device. Mine still has music and podcasts. It has tools straight out of Harry Potter: The Knight Bus (Uber and Lyft) and the Weasleys’ clock (Find Friends). I can read foreign languages with Google Translate. I can talk to Siri, and she (often) understands me. My phone still has fantastic maps and a kick-ass camera. It even has a flashlight!

On my OnePlus 5T, I have neither Chrome nor social apps, but I still have Google Maps, Line (WeChat/WhatsApp equivalent in Japan), Pocket Casts and some others, which I don't spend too much time.

I can do stuff but I cannot kill time on my phone. Being bored is good, especially as a parent. Kids don't interrupt you when you do nothing. They are actually giving things to do for you, from playing with Lego to changing diapers.
