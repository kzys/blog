I occasionally browse Linux and PC laptops. One thing surprises me is that HiDPI screens are still only for top-notch models.

For example, System76's laptops are mostly Full HD. [Adder WS](https://system76.com/laptops/adder) is 4K OLED (3840x2160) but the price is $2,199. [Dell XPS 13](https://www.dell.com/en-us/member/shop/dell-laptops/new-xps-13-laptop/spd/xps-13-9300-laptop/xn9300cto220s) has UHD+ (3840 x 2400) option and the price after adding th option is ~$1,400. [ThinkPad X1 Yoga](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpad-x1/ThinkPad-X1-Yoga-3rd-Gen/p/20LFS06F00) is WQHD (2560 x 1440) and the price is ~1,200.

In this regard, Apple laptops are still great. The cheapest MacBook Air is $999 but has "Retina" display (2560 x 1600), which is slightly taller than WQHD (2560 x 1440).

I hope manufacturers see HiDPI as normal. Even my OnePlus 5T, a 2017 budget phone has Full HD+ (2160 x 1080). The resolution is for hand-held devices! Laptops must have more pixels to be "crisp" for eyes. We are spoiled. Please!
