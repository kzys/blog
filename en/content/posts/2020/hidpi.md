I occasionally browse Linux and PC laptops. One thing surprises me is that HiDPI screens are still only for flagship models.

For example, System76's laptops are mostly Full HD. [Adder WS](https://system76.com/laptops/adder) is 4K OLED (3840x2160) but the price is $2,199. [Dell XPS 13](https://www.dell.com/en-us/member/shop/dell-laptops/new-xps-13-laptop/spd/xps-13-9300-laptop/xn9300cto220s) has UHD+ (3840 x 2400) option and the price after adding the option is ~$1,400. [ThinkPad X1 Yoga](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpad-x1/ThinkPad-X1-Yoga-3rd-Gen/p/20LFS06F00) is WQHD (2560 x 1440) and the price is ~$1,200.

In this regard, I still like Apple laptops. The cheapest MacBook Air is $999 but has "Retina" display (2560 x 1600), which is slightly taller than WQHD (2560 x 1440).

As a spoiled Apple user, I hope manufacturers see HiDPI as normal. My [OnePlus 5T](https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_5t-8912.php), 2017 "flagship killer" budget phone has Full HD+ (1080 x 2160). [Nokia 6.2](https://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_6_2-9834.php), 2019 budget phone is Full HD+ (1080 x 2280). And these phones have obviously smaller screens than laptops. Large laptop screens must have more pixels to be "crisp" for eyes. Please!
