I've removed my Instagram account this Saturday, June 27th. It is an act of declutter and there is no drama behind it. 

Simply I don't use Instagram much. Removing stuff there wouldn't annoy people. In addition to that, occasionally I got a "password reset" email from Instagram. Someone might want my login name. Removing my account may give someone the name.

Instagram has a data export option and I downloaded all of my photos.
