It is.

I was watching news way too much last week. There were protests, and then curfews in Seattle. People were maced and tear-gassed.

My wife and I watched [13th](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5895028/) on Netflix, because [Bryan Cantrill recommended that on his blog](http://dtrace.org/blogs/bmc/2020/06/02/the-singular-urgency-of-ava-duvernays-13th/). It was shocking.
