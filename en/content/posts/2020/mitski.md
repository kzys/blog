I first saw Mitski at [Under the Rader magazine](http://www.undertheradarmag.com/news/under_the_radar_announces_issue_65_with_mitski_and_boygenius_on_the_covers/) on a public library. She was on the cover and her Japanese-sounded name caught my eyes. Yes. She is an American-Japanese songwriter.

I especially like "Nobody".
