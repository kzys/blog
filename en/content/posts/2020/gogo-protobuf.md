Google is releasing [a new Go API for protobuf](https://blog.golang.org/protobuf-apiv2), which breaks gogo/protobuf, but [the project is now looking for new maintainers](https://github.com/gogo/protobuf/issues/691).

It is sad to see people are just switching from gogo/protobuf rather than helping, but I would do the same. Maintaining an RPC binding cannot be done in my spare time...
