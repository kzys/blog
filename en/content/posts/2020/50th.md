This is my 50th post of #100DaysToOffload challenge. I have reached 50%! Based on the number of the days I spent to write these 50 posts, writing 100 posts in a year seems achievable.

A few Japanese developers I know also (re)started blogging and/or writing more frequently, which is pretty cool.

### Less Rants?

I think I have written more about stuff I like, which is good! I don't say being critical is bad (ranting is bad). But I don't want to be a critic here.

### More Pictures!

For the next 10 posts, I'd like to have more pictures on this blog. I have a Nikon's DSLR and Sony's RX100, but haven't used them much nowadays. This is certainly inspired by [A Day in the Life](https://secon.dev/).
