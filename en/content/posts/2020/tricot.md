tricot is a Japanese rock band. The small sub-genre they belong often called "math rock" in Western.

While they sing exclusively in Japanese, they have international fans and appeared in [Fader](https://www.thefader.com/2015/10/24/tricot-gen-f-interview) (2015), [Vice](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qkgxxx/with-3-tricot-proves-theyre-the-greatest-trio-on-earth) (2017) and [NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2018/05/22/613008999/tricot-splatters-paint-onto-brightly-colored-potage) (2018). They have toured multiple countries even before signing with a major label.

I thought they would become a band which is known in other countries rather than Japan, such as Cibo Matto or Shonen Knife. But they recently signed with Avex, one of the major labels in Japan. tricot's lead vocal, Ikkyu Nakajima also sings in Genine High, that apparently brings new fans. All data points I have is YouTube's comments though.

So, tricot would be big in 2020!
