I've been working from home for months now. Naturally I'm spending more time with my family -- my wife and kids.

I can hear all the fights they have and all the grinning moments they share. Well, to be fair, I sometimes have both as well. I can have not only dinner but also lunch with them. I even make meals sometimes.

And that feels great.

Of course, I may not be super-productive by sharing the space. I could ignore all of them when I was in the office.

And that feels odd now. Do I really want to ignore them by being far away from them? Do I have to be *that* productive? We all say family is the first priority. Yet, we stay away from them for 8 hours times 5 days every week. Then we only spend time with them for the rest of the week, two days.
