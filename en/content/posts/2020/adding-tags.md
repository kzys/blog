Despite the fact that this Hugo instance has been around for 3 years, I've never added tags on my posts. It is bit awkward to manually add "Go" when a post itself contains "Go".

But, well, I've changed my mind.

Hugo's [Taxonomies](https://gohugo.io/content-management/taxonomies/) page explains the overall and [Taxonomy Templates](https://gohugo.io/templates/taxonomy-templates/) page describes the way to show taxonomies in templates. I also added a bit of CSS to make it looks nice. I still cannot write Flexbox without googling. [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) is my go-to.

The only downside would be losing "3/100"-style count-up. I'm going to do that every 10 posts or so.
