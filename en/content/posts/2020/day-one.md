I've found [100 Days to Offload](https://100daystooffload.com/) via [Blogging is not dead](https://www.garron.blog/en/blog/blogging.html).

> #100DaysToOffload is a simple concept that Kev Quirk thought of one day. The rationale behind the whole thing is to challenge people to publish 100 posts on their personal blog in a year. That's approximately 1 post every 3.5 days.

I do like the idea! So, I'm going to start the challenge from today.

For me, having 100 posts in a year is definitely a stretch goal. I used to write a lot more often, but I had neither kids nor a full-time job at that time. And even that days, I rarely had 100 posts in a year.

On the other hand, my day job is mostly writing open-source software. It is possible to write about what I did. For example, I cherry-picked [Maksym's fix](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/4195) on containerd from `master` to `release/1.3` and [the PR](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/4278) has been merged today. Well, this one may not be that interesting, since I literally did `git cherry-pick` three times and that's all.

Anyway I will write more often here! Do or do not. There is no try.
