This is the 70th post of my #100DaysToOffload challenge. Now I can see the goal!

The last 10 posts were mostly tech-focused. While I've watched the presidential election in the States, I didn't write about it. I don't want to write about it.

Not talking about politics could be a privilege. I can agree that [tech is and always will be political](https://twitter.com/rustlang/status/1267519582505512960).

But I don't want to talk about politic here, at this time.
