I like meditation. For computer nerds, I would explain that meditation is like stopping all background processes in your mind.

I have used [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/) and it was awesome, but it is also expensive. I know that making a modern mobile app is a continuous effort, but $69.99/year is not for me.

[Medito](https://meditofoundation.org/) is a free alternative app. Interestingly the app is owned and developed by a non-profit organization in Netherlands.
