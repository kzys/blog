My wife and I were into board games in, I think 2015. We were pretty new to Seattle. We met a lot of people at that time. A few played board games with us and we were hooked. We went [Mox](https://www.moxboardinghouse.com/seattle/) in Seattle and [Sugorokuya](https://sugorokuya.jp/) in Tokyo. We read [After School Dice Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After_School_Dice_Club). We bought a few games.

But then, after having kids, these games had been collecting dusts.

Fast forward to maybe last week, I played a few games with my daughter. She was fine about basics and apparently enjoyed the games. We played a few this week as well.

While she of course needs some hand-holding, I feel that I'm hitting a milestone. A milestone to say that we could enjoy what we have enjoyed again, this time with our kids!
