I still read Hacker News. This week I found [Rediscovering the Small Web](https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/) there. The post itself is something I can relate to. And then on [the HN thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23326329), I found [Fraidycat](https://fraidyc.at/).

Fraidycat is a small RSS/Atom reader with steroids. With [some HTML scraping](https://github.com/kickscondor/fraidycat/blob/9e3b782b0ab086b82f64aa6548c79530ccf593dc/defs/social.json), it can follow popular websites without RSS/Atom feeds, such as Twitter. And no matter how frequently people post, they only have roughly two lines each.

As an old Japanese internet geek, it reminds me [WWWC](https://www.nakka.com/wwwc/) and antennas. Those are pre-RSS, internet update "checkers". Antennas are also working as a blogroll before blogging. Its history is fascinating and I'd write more about that, but not this time.

I've been using Feedly after Google Reader's shutdown. Before that, I was using livedoor Reader and Bloglines. Now I'm trying Fraidycat on Firefox. I like it so far. The small sparklines, the cat, and the colors. It has some "why the lucky stiff" feeling and 90's/00's internet vibe.
