I still read Hacker News. This week I found [Rediscovering the Small Web](https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/) there. The post itself is something I can relate to. And then on [the HN thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23326329), I found [Fraidycat](https://fraidyc.at/).

Fraidycat is a small RSS/Atom reader with steroids. As an old Japanese internet geek, it reminds me [WWWC](https://www.nakka.com/wwwc/) and antennas. Those are pre-RSS, internet update "checkers". Antennas are also working as a blogroll before blogging. Its history is fascinating and I'd write more about that, but not this time.

Now I'm trying Fraidycat on Firefox. I like it so far.

* It is designed to be not too fast. I can read (or skip) posts by grasping the titles first. I can let its cralwer to check some feeds less frequently.
* By [HTML scraping](https://github.com/kickscondor/fraidycat/blob/9e3b782b0ab086b82f64aa6548c79530ccf593dc/defs/social.json), it works as a Twitter client and supports some popular websites that have no RSS/Atom feeds.
* All sites only have 2 lines, no matter how frequently people update. There is no "Twitterstorm" problem.
* The small sparklines, the cat, and the colors. It has some "why the lucky stiff" feeling.

I’ve been using Feedly after Google Reader’s shutdown. Before that, I was using livedoor Reader and Bloglines. I may switch from Feedly to Fraidycat.
