This week was busy. While [I have written](https://blog.8-p.info/en/2020/10/01/work-life/),

> From now on, I'm going to turn-off my work laptop after work.

I didn't. I have also enabled Chrome again on my phone, while I know [it may not work for me](https://blog.8-p.info/en/2020/08/13/action-dash/). This has an explanation. The preschool my kid is in has introduced a QR code-based contact-less check-in. That being said, my wife usually drops off my kid.

I have also read Twitter more than what I like. My friend has been hosting [a Japanese tech podcast](https://misreading.chat/) and I was a guest a few weeks back. This might be a small nudge to check Twitter to see its feedback.

Those things are not really bad, but I do think they are like snacking. They are designed to give you relatively instant gratification. Nowadays I even think "work" is like that. Probably startups and/or super-senior developers' work are different. But where I work and at my level, things are broken into achievable tasks.

Parenting in general, dealing with some "life" events or learning hard materials wouldn't go that way. I could and should be able to broke them into achievable small tasks. But it is not happening by default. And I've been feeling that I didn't make enough progress on these big problems.

So snacking is not bad, but snacking without having real meals is bad.

How about blogging? [Derek Sivers has said](https://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_keep_your_goals_to_yourself/transcript) "keep your goals to yourself" in his one of the TED talks.

> Ideally you would not be satisfied until you'd actually done the work. But when you tell someone your goal and they acknowledge it, psychologists have found that it's called a "social reality." The mind is kind of tricked into feeling that it's already done.

In this sense, sharing good goals here would give me some gratification, which is too early to enjoy.
