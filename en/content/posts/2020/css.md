This blog right now has two-column layout which is like [Edward Tufte](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/) and [Ink & Switch](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first.html). I like sidenotes.

But I don't like to see source code in a narrow column. So I've figured out the way to make source code wider than the surrounding box. That involves CSS' new additions: `calc`, `var`, and `vw`.

When I wonder about [Lightweight Web](https://blog.8-p.info/en/2020/08/17/web/), I'm unsure what would be "Lightweight CSS". While I do agree CSS is really complex and the complexity makes developing new browsers harder, CSS' new additions are actually good and useful, at least for me.
