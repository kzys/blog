solderpunk, the founder of Gemini protocol has written about his "offline first", more intentional computing.

- [Progress towards "offline first"](https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/gemini.circumlunar.space/~solderpunk/gemlog/progress-toward-offline-first.gmi)
- [Computing less, but with more focus](https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/gemini.circumlunar.space/~solderpunk/gemlog/computing-less-but-with-more-focus.gmi)

I have tried that when I was in Japan. [I had cancelled my home internet in 2010](https://blog.8-p.info/2010/24-unwired) and had only used Wi-Fi in McDonald's and such. [Blue Square Cafe in Shinjuku was my favorite](https://blog.8-p.info/2010/27-may) at that time. The experiment lasted [four months](https://blog.8-p.info/2010/34-bic-wimax).

While it was fine, evidently speaking, I didn't love that much. So, I haven't tried the experiment again. For me, cancelling a home internet is impractical now due to WFH and other family members. But being intentional is something I could do still.

By the way, his gemlog (Gemini + Blog) and the discussions highlighted there were interesting, such as [Reimagining the internet](https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/gemini.circumlunar.space/~solderpunk/gemlog/reimagining-the-internet.gmi).
