Inspired by Kicks Condor's [Foundations of a Tiny Directory](https://www.kickscondor.com/foundations-of-a-tiny-directory), [his intro (which is actually not) of Marijnâ€™s Link Cabinet](https://www.kickscondor.com/marijn%27s-link-cabinet) and [OMGLORD](https://omglord.com/), I've started [links.8-p.info](https://links.8-p.info/).

This is my personal web directory. Some of the links are really big and/or mainstream. Me introducing these sites seem like an indie small YouTuber is introducing [Casey Neistat](https://www.youtube.com/user/caseyneistat).

But in the meantime, how do people find, let's say [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/)? By retweets? On Hacker News? If you are a curious teenager living in a local town, believing that nobody in the town are into computers, where do you start?

So, I think connecting the great bits of the internet is still worth to do. Also I can read/write Japanese which is a plus. I know some good sites that Japanese people may know but others won't.
