I was thinking about enabling this blog's RSS - [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) - Twitter integration once again, and then found that Chris Krycho left Twitter completely. I know and like him because his [New Rustacean](https://newrustacean.com/) podcast. He has elaborated the reasons on [Breaking Up With Social Media](https://v4.chriskrycho.com/2019/breaking-up-with-social-media).

Unlike Chris, I would not delete my Twitter account. Compared to my Instagram account which I've deleted, I feel that my tweets were somewhat connected to other tweets. I had meaningful conversations and I don't want to delete them. I do hate 404s on the internet. [Cool URIs don't change](https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI).

That being said, I can relate to what he has elaborated. So I may not enable the Twitter integration and be better at handling the silence.
