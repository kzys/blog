You might have seen NODE, or its domain `n-o-d-e.net` on Hacker News or some other link aggregators. They are making cool hardware projects from [Raspberry Pi mini server](https://n-o-d-e.net/node_mini_server3.html) to [Casio's cheap watch mod](https://n-o-d-e.net/datarunner.html).

In addition to the cool hardware projects, they have [zines](https://n-o-d-e.net/zine/index.html).

I've downloaded the PDF version of the zines and reading them right now. They are good. The theme is like [Make:](https://makezine.com/) magazine, but has more decentralized, privacy-aware, self-sufficient and "hacker" vibe.
