I had a haircut in Saturday. While getting a clipper was option, I went to a nearby barber.

The experience was of course different. I had a temperature check in the beginning. I couldn't wait inside and reading magazines. I was wearing a mask while having a haircut.

I also shaved off my goatee. I stopped shaving off that in the beginning of this pandemic, but it was itchy to keep after wearing a mask was becoming mandatory in many places.
