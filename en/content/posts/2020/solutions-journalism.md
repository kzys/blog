A few years ago, I read Google Assistant's [tell me something good](https://www.blog.google/products/assistant/hey-google-tell-me-something-good/) and learned about solutions journalism.

> The stories come from a wide range of media outlets, curated and summarized by the [Solutions Journalism Network](https://www.solutionsjournalism.org/). Theyâ€™re a nonpartisan nonprofit dedicated to spreading the practice of solutions journalism, which highlights how problems are solvable and that doing better is possible.

Ever since I occasionally think about the mix of information I read. Don't I read too much problems, without knowing the responses? The answer tends to be "yes".

Honestly speaking, I haven't figured out the way to read news as a grown-up. I was reading the New York Times' Coronavirus newsletter in the beginning of this pandemic. It was good. but I've unsubscribed that recently since things wouldn't move that fast. I read neither daily newspapers nor [the Economist magazine](https://medium.com/make-time/why-i-ignore-the-daily-news-and-read-the-economist-instead-and-how-you-can-too-53f4d255efa6).
