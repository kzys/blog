Fargate's platform version 1.4.0 has been released yesterday.

* [AWS Fargate launches platform version 1.4.0](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/aws-fargate-launches-platform-version-1-4/)
* [Under the hood: Fargate data plane](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/under-the-hood-fargate-data-plane/)

This is the first Fargate release I've helped. That's all I wanted to write about today and kids nowadays may just "tweet" about that instead of blogging. No. I *was* using Twitter. I was one of the cool kids before.

Anyway, yay!
