This is my 30th post of #100DaysToOffload challenge. The pace of the writing stays almost the same (10 posts / 20 days).

### Twitter

I'm still not so sure what I'd like to do with Twitter. Twitter is still fast and noisy. I agree that [Unwoke](https://www.unwoke.hr/) is bad. Do I have to know about Unwoke and voice my concern? That's pretty much [Duty Calls](https://xkcd.com/386/) situation.

### Emacs

I don't feel bad about using Magit. I still use GoLand and Visual Studio Code much. I haven't used any [language servers](https://langserver.org/) with Emacs.
