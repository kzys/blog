[Casey Neistat](https://www.youtube.com/user/caseyneistat) is back, apparently. He is a vlogger. While he wouldn't be the first vlogger, he could be considered as the godfather of modern, DSLR-holding vlogging.

I'm unsure what he would do and apparently he neither. Honestly speaking, the last "368" season is a bit of meh. It was ended abruptly by Casey's move from New York City. Is the space still open? What was the project with Jack Conte?

That being said, I'm happy to see that he is staring a new vlog again!

The rest of this post is my Casey Neistat bookmarks :)

## Meta

I like his "meta" backstage-ish vlogs.

* [HOW TO VLOG LIKE CASEY NEISTAT by CASEY NEISTAT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q980C74SdYQ): Casey explains the difference between his vlog and the precedents.
* [Casey Neistat's Guide to Filmmaking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSUrTxquyE)
* [WHY I ALWAYS WEAR SUNGLASSES](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFbJoXJBIIA): Pretty practical.

## Studio

His studio is great.
