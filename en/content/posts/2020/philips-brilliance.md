To improve my working from home situation, I bought Philips Brilliance 27 inch 4k monitor with USB-C docking (272P7VUBNB). This monitor is 4k, USB Type-C and sub-$350. I'm not picky about color. It looks good to me.

### 4k 60Hz

My home computer is 13-inch 2017 MacBook Pro. I initially struggled to get 4k 60Hz from USB Type-C connection.

First this monitor supports both USB 2.0 and USB 3.2, but in order to use USB Type-C, you must use USB 2.0. Second, On MacBook Pro side, I need to [reset NVRAM](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204063). Resetting NVRAM is like restarting the computer to fix a problem. I really don't know what was wrong.
