I used to leave my work laptop at office, except for on-call weeks and some crunch time. However since this pandemic, my work laptop is always on and connected to a larger display. It is essentially "ready".

And then, I tend to do a bit of stuff there even after having dinner. That's a bad habit which eventually results burnout. Or even it wouldn't, I have other things to deal with. Work is designed to be achievable, manageable and somewhat fulfilling, whereas life is not. I must intentionally separate myself from work to do some hard stuff. I meant, hard for me. Like decluttering home.

From now on, I'm going to turn-off my work laptop after work. I usually don't turn off laptops regardless of work or personal one, but I usually don't work from home also. Different situation needs different solution.
