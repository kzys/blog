This is my 20th post of #100DaysToOffload challenge. Hmm, seems I'm writing the last 10 posts much faster than the first 10 posts. This is good.

Apparently #100DaysToOffload caught some eyes in the Japanese tech internet community. morygonzalez has started [his challenge](https://portalshit.net/2020/07/10/going-to-try-100-days-to-offload). taizoo is joining in [his own way](https://scrapbox.io/hub/%E8%BB%BD%E3%81%84%E3%83%91%E3%83%B3%E3%83%81%E3%81%A7%E6%89%8B%E6%95%B0%E3%81%8C%E5%A4%9A%E3%81%84%E3%81%BB%E3%81%86%E3%81%8C%E3%82%A4%E3%82%A4).

### Taking a break from Twitter

I have IFTTT that tweets my new blog posts automatically, but I'm going to disable the integration for at least the next 10 posts. Seeing Likes on my tweets made me motiviated about writing. That's for sure. But I also want to stay away from Twitter.

Twitter is simply too fast for me. Also people tend to be mad about stuff there, which I don't want to be with. Don't have to be mad about stuff would be considered as a privilege though.
