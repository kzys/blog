I recently know [Gemini](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/) and a renaissance of Gopher.

> Gemini is a new, collaboratively designed internet protocol, which explores the space inbetween gopher and the web, striving to address (perceived) limitations of one while avoiding the (undeniable) pitfalls of the other.

Gemini is a pretty simple network protocol and a hypertext format (`text/gemini`). Unlike [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/), Gemini is not for building a decentralized web.

I do like the simplicity. HTTP and HTML are getting pretty complicated. HTTP/3 is probably a big engineering win that allows us to send more bytes efficiently, but the overall complexity makes me down. Along with the complexity of HTML + CSS + JavaScript, [as Drew DeVault wrote, it is impossible to build a new web browser](https://drewdevault.com/2020/03/18/Reckless-limitless-scope.html).

Gemini is first proposed in [solderpunk's phlog](gopher://zaibatsu.circumlunar.space:70/0/~solderpunk/phlog/protocol-pondering-intensifies.txt). This link may not work for you since it is in gopher://. Yes, that Gopher protocol. There is a huge Gopher community out there in 2020. [Vice is covering the scece in 2017](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9kwek8/long-live-gopher-the-techies-keeping-the-text-driven-internet-alive).

Gopher and pubnix (public unix) servers and the whole phlogsphere remind me the early Internet. I'm not that early but still.
