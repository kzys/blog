This year is almost over. A meeting I've scheduled today is in January 2021!

I will take two weeks off from December 21st. In Japan, the end of a year and the beginning of the next year are like Thanksgiving and Christmas combined for American people. Companies mostly have official holidays. People go back to their hometowns. We have [nice traditional foods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osechi). While I won't go Japan this year, my Japanese brain still needs this moment of isolation and self reflection, even after living in the States for more than six years.

I may or may not do some non-work computer stuff during the off. I want to kick-start some personal projects, but I also think I should have some no screen time.
