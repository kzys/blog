According to Quora itself, I joined Quora in March 2012, but I haven't used much. No answers, no questions. Their "More related to [What you clicked a few days ago]" email is annoying.

So I'm deleting my account there.

[Deleting an account in Quora is straightforward](https://help.quora.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004250866). Note that, if you login Quora via Google/Facebook, you need to create a password first.

[I deleted my Instagram account in 2020](https://blog.8-p.info/en/2020/06/28/instagram/). I haven't deleted my Facebook account yet.
