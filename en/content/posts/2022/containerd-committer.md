I've become a containerd committer yesterday.
Derek opened [a pull request](https://github.com/containerd/project/pull/84) in March 3rd and it was merged finally.

containerd as a project has two types of maintainers: "reviewers" and "committers". Reviewers can review and approve pull requests. Committers can merge pull requests in addition to what reviewers can do. Originally only committers were considered as "maintainers", but [it was changed in 2021](https://github.com/containerd/project/pull/70). Now maintainers = committers + reviewers.

I started contributing containerd back in March 2020. Fixing [a cgroup bug](https://github.com/containerd/cgroups/pull/147) was my first pull request, which was needed for Fargate Platfrom Version 1.4. Then [I became a reviewer in 2021](https://blog.8-p.info/en/2021/01/19/containerd-reviewer/). Now I'm a committer.

It has been a great journey so far. I hope that continues! Well, now I have to do more than just hoping though :)
