I've written way too much about *not* using Twitter last year. It looks crazy.

> I have IFTTT that tweets my new blog posts automatically, but I’m going to disable the integration for at least the next 10 posts.

[Twitter](https://blog.8-p.info/en/2020/08/09/twitter/)

> So I may not enable the Twitter integration and be better at handling the silence.

> I’m still not so sure what I’d like to do with Twitter.

> I have also read Twitter more than what I like.

[Social Media Saturday](https://blog.8-p.info/en/2021/01/02/social-media-saturday/) is working okay. I still unblock Twitter from time to time. I no longer read Hacker News and Lobsters.

Twitter is designed to be a low-friction, impulsive medium. My ["Joining containerd" post](https://blog.8-p.info/en/2021/01/19/containerd-reviewer/) got some warm welcome tweets from other maintainers because of the low-friction. But people tweet and fight too much there because of the low-friction.
