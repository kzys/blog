I've been reading about "digital gardening", starting from Maggie Appleton's [A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history).

It is an interesting movement which reminds me the web before blogging. Digital gardens are

- Inter-connected than chronological
- More iterative than "fire and forget"
- More authentic than polished, performative blogging

In my view, blogging vs. digital gardening is unnecessary binary. It may be more like a spectrum. Some blogs are more garden-ish and some of them are more like magazines.

### Blogging is constrained. It is a trade-off.

That being said, I do agree that blogging is constrained, compared to what digital medium could possibly do. The constraints are trade-offs. Blogging makes WWW more like magazines, better or worse. It is more familiar, easy to start, maintain and follow others. We are not hypertext natives.
