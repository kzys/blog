Seattle Public Library (SPL) has O'Reilly subscription, called [O'Reilly Complete Public Library](https://www.spl.org/books-and-media/books-and-ebooks/oreilly-complete-public-library).

> Improve your computer and business skills with O'Reilly Complete Public Library. You can read more than 40,000 books on software, programming and business for free with your Library card using standard web browsers, with no due dates.

Seems many public libraries in the States do the same, from [District of Columbia Public Library](https://www.dclibrary.org/oreilly), [San Jose Public Library](https://www.sjpl.org/blog/oreilly-public-libraries-need-technical-computer-or-science-book-right-away) to [Madison Public Library](https://www.madisonpubliclibrary.org/resources/eresources/oreilly-public-libraries-previously-safari-books-online). Although they have a few limitations compared to real O'Reilly subscription, which are explained in [ProQuest](https://proquest.libguides.com/oreilly/features) [^PQ].

* [You cannot create a personal account](https://proquest.libguides.com/oreilly/features)
* [Things that are connected to individuals, such as highlights won't be saved](https://proquest.libguides.com/oreilly/highlights)
* [O'Reilly's app doesn't work](https://proquest.libguides.com/oreilly/app)

I've been having O'Reilly subscription from [my ACM membership](https://learning.acm.org/e-learning). Seems ACM's one is still better than SPL's one. Of course SPL's one is completely free if you live in Seattle though.

That being said, as a former Japanese resident, I'd say that having O'Reilly subscription though a public library is *awesome*. Too good to be true, to be honest.

[^PQ]: I'm not totally sure about the connection between ProQuest and the public libraries. Is ProQuest the vendor who brings O'Reilly to the public libraries?
