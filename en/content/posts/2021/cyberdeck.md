I've spent too much time browsing these cyberdecks. Cyberdecks are portable computers with cyberpunk aesthetics.

* [The Cyberdeck Cafe](https://cyberdeck.cafe/)
* [Realworld cyberdecks](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberDeck/)
* [BACK7.CO](https://back7.co/)

I may need to build one, probably simpler one like [Minimalist Cyberdeck](https://nearphuture.org/technology/minimalist-cyberdeck/).
