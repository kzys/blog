This is the 90th post of my [100 Days To Offload](https://100daystooffload.com/) challenge. One of the guidelines is

> Publish 100 new posts in the space of a year.

I interpret that as "365 days" rather than "before December 31st". So my challenge was started in 2020, but it will end in 2021. This may be misinterpretation of the original guidelines, but they are guidelines, not rules :)

Anyway, I only have 10 posts remaining. What will I write about?

I'd continue "Inside runc" series. Honestly speaking, it is a bit dull to write about containers,
after working on containers at work though.
I may look back some of the old posts from this challenge and give readers updates.
I always want to write a mid-size program outside of my work and write about its progress. Maybe this time?
