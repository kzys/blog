I've recently read about the death of Vicha Ratanapakdee, the surge of anti-Asian racism, and "Model Minority Myth".

Identifying myself as an Asian and being a minority is something I'm "getting" recently. I've been in Japan for almost 30 years. Asians in Asian countries wouldn't recognize themselves as "Asian". At least I didn't. And Japanese men are definitely a majority in Computer Science departments and software industry in Japan.

Some Japanese woman engineers recently blogged her stories;

- [1人の女性がエンジニアになるまで ](https://note.com/wiroha/n/n72cd1ad2d168)
- [1人の女性がエンジニアになるまで 〜yuryuの場合〜 ](https://note.com/yuryu/n/n7d8730b8bba0)

I didn't have that kind of struggle myself. In hindsight, I was an ignorant about the difficulty of being a minority.

Do I really experience the difficulty day-to-day now? Not really. Asian men are not a minority in software industry in Seattle.

But the recent events reminded me that I'm a minority in the States. This is the first time in my life...
