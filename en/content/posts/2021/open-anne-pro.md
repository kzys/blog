[Open Anne Pro](https://openannepro.github.io/) is an alternative firmware for Anne Pro 2 keyboard.

> From my short and limited experience with the original firmware provided by ObinsLab, I find it to be extremely buggy. One of the most significant problem being compatibility in BIOS. Aside from buggy, I would also like to switch the “Magic FN” from caps lock to other keys.

I personally haven't been experienced any issues and don't think Anne Pro 2's official firmware is buggy. That being said, seeing an alternative firmware is pretty cool.

Technically Open Anne Pro has two firmware. The keyboard firmware is QMK port and fully functional, but the LED firmware only has basic features.
