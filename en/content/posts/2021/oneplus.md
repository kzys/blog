My OnePlus 5T is having [a chipmunk sound issue](https://piunikaweb.com/2021/02/05/hearing-distorted-chipmunk-sounds-on-your-oneplus-5-5t-while-on-calls-workaround/). Interestingly [Nokia phones](https://community.phones.nokia.com/discussion/54463/call-distortion-since-update-to-android-10) are having the same issue.

While killing VoLTE and WiFi calling fixed the issue for me, it is sad to see that such a fundamental feature can be broken in 2021. Modern software is weird.
