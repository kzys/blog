[CoRecursive podcast](https://corecursive.com/) is good. I have listened [Full-Time Open Source](https://corecursive.com/067-zig-with-andrew-kelley/) (which is about Zig),
[The Untold Story of SQLite](https://corecursive.com/066-sqlite-with-richard-hipp/) and
[Software That Doesn't Suck](https://corecursive.com/software-that-doesnt-suck-with-jim-blandy/) (which is about Subversion), and all of them are quite interesting.

The host, Adam Gordon Bell's editing seems more intentional than other tech podcasts. He sometimes insert a third-person voice over, [such as](https://corecursive.com/067-zig-with-andrew-kelley/);

> **Adam:** Andrew understood before he even started what the C language brought to the table, and this is important. C is a small language and itâ€™s everywhere. C is used by 20% of software developers according to the Stack Overflow Survey. Some conditions may apply there.

I think that he is replacing some back-and-forth conversation with this technique to make an episode more "dense", which I like.
