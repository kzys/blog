I'm currently reading [Own Your Tech Career](https://www.manning.com/books/own-your-tech-career). One of the recommendations the author made is having a professional online identity and be mindful and possibly separate private topics such as politics. While I can agree that is reasonable, I personally haven't.

The domain of this blog, 8-p.info was actually chosen to reject that sort of financial industry-safe seriousness. I like [Kicks Condor](https://www.kickscondor.com/) and [the Whimsical Web](https://whimsical.club/) and ultimately want to make something like that.

That being said, rejecting the idea without trying is something I'd like to avoid, especially nowadays since I'm getting older.

So I would try "blogging like a pro" a bit for the rest of this year, like post mostly technical stuff at regular intervals and resume social media for a while. I did [the other side of the spectrum for a while](https://blog.8-p.info/en/2021/02/12/100th/). So doing the opposite may make sense.
