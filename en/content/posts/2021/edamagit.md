[Magit](https://magit.vc/) is one of the reasons I still use Emacs.

A few days ago, I tried [Edamagit](https://github.com/kahole/edamagit). It looked great, but I wanted to split a frame [^FRAME] horizontally as like Emacs. Sadly I can't because [Visual Studio Code itself can't split a frame horizontally](https://github.com/kahole/edamagit/issues/109). This modern 286.9 MB editor which has entire Blink inside can't split a frame horizontally...

I use Emacs less than what I used to be, but it probably won't go down to zero. I still like Emacs.

[^FRAME]: It is a window. Emacs calls what modern people call windows "frames".
