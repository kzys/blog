I've just joined [the containerd project](https://github.com/containerd/) as a reviewer! [The pull request that adds my GitHub alias](https://github.com/containerd/project/pull/62) has been merged today.

In containerd, reviewers can, well, review pull requests. That's pretty much self-explanatory. Here is the official definition from [containerd's Project Governance document](https://github.com/containerd/project/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md).

> A reviewer is a core role within the project. They share in reviewing issues and pull requests and their LGTM counts towards the required LGTM count to merge a code change into the project.
>
> Reviewers are part of the organization but do not have write access. Becoming a reviewer is a core aspect in the journey to becoming a maintainer.

Technically speaking, anyone can review pull requests and I've been reviewing them. But now my approval actually counts towards the required LGTM count!
