I had written about [Fraidycat](https://fraidyc.at/) in [2020](https://blog.8-p.info/en/2020/05/30/fraidycat/).

> I’ve been using Feedly after Google Reader’s shutdown. Before that, I was using livedoor Reader and Bloglines. I may switch from Feedly to Fraidycat.

The switch didn't happen. I ended up back to [Feedly](https://feedly.com/) again. I've been using RSS readers for a decade [^DECADE] and seems I cannot go back anymore.

> This is one reason I was happy to see RSS fall out of favor. I don’t really want to read everything in Arial, gray on white with a little blue. Blog posts that were beautifully arranged in their homes, now stuffed together into a makeshift public shelter of dreary gray and white and chalked around with a little line of blue.

While I can understand this sentiment, I'm so used to that gray-and-white world. I'd like to read all blogs from my RSS reader without leaving there, even that loses a bit of personality.

That being said, Fraidycat is nice. I like the feature that I can follow certain sources intentionally slowly.

[^DECADE]: Things I've been using since college all now fall into "I've been using X for more than a decade" bucket, which is overwhelming. Am I that old?
