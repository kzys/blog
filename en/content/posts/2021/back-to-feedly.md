I had [written](https://blog.8-p.info/en/2020/05/30/fraidycat/) about [Fraidycat](https://fraidyc.at/) in 2020, but I've moved back to [Feedly](https://feedly.com/).

I've been using RSS readers for more than a decade [^DECADE]. The first was Bloglines. Then livedoor Reader and Google Reader. After Google Reader's shutdown, I was settled on Feedly.

Fraidycat is nice. Especially I like the feature that you can follow certain things intentionally slowly. But it couldn't replace Feedly for me. So for reducing the number of inboxes, I've moved my blog subscriptuons to Feedly again.

> This is one reason I was happy to see RSS fall out of favor. I donâ€™t really want to read everything in Arial, gray on white with a little blue. Blog posts that were beautifully arranged in their homes, now stuffed together into a makeshift public shelter of dreary gray and white and chalked around with a little line of blue.

While I can understand their feeling and I want to make 8-p.info less gray-on-white. But in the meantime I'm so used to that gray-on-white world, and I'm okay with it.

[^DECADE]: Things I've been using since college all now fall into "I've been using X for more than a decade" bucket, which is overwhelming. Am I that old?
