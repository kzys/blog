I learned Unix by reading books, magazines and blogs. It was long time ago. One resource I still can remember and like is "Unix Programming Environment" by Brian W. Kernighan and Rob Pike. I read its Japanese translation from ASCII [^ASCII].However this book was aged even at that time and the original English version from Prentice-Hall seems discontinued. It is not something I could recommend to others.

MIT CSAIL's [the Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) looks good. I only have skimmed through though. It is good to see that [the page mentions `man`](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/shell-tools/);

> A more detailed approach is to use the man command. Short for manual, man provides a manual page (called manpage) for a command you specify.

But new developers also should know the difference between `kill(1)` and `kill(2)`. How do people learn that nowadays?

[^ASCII]: No. Not American Standard Code for Information Interchange. There is a Japanese company called ASCII. The publishing label is now called ASCII Dwango which sells technical books such as [the Rust Programming Language](https://nostarch.com/Rust2018)'s [Japanese translation](https://asciidwango.jp/post/185381172080/).
