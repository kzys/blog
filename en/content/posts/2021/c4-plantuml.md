[C4-PlantUML](https://github.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML) is a PlantUML library based on [the C4 model](https://c4model.com/). C4 means "Context, Containers, Components, and Code", so four C's.

PlantUML's default color scheme it's own. C4-PlantUML removes the PlantUML-ness nicely. My only pet peeve is about C4's terminology. Most of diagrams I write are somewhat related to Linux containers. So "containers" in the diagrams must mean "Linux containers". Otherwise people will be really confused.
