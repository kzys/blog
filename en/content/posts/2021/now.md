I've added [my now page](https://8-p.info/now/) on 8-p.info. The term is [coined by Derek Sivers in 2015](https://sive.rs/nowff) and there is an aggregator website called [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com/).

While I knew the existence, I wasn't sure that is for me. I already have a blog that I could post "what I'm doing for now". Do I really need another page? Honestly speaking, I'm still not 100% sure how long and/or often maintain the now page.

On the other hand, I like the now pages' "have your own site" vibe and the emphasis on a midterm perspective. It feels "slower" than the big mainstream internet and I like it.

### Derek Sivers uses Drew DeVault's Sourcehut

By the way, [Derek Sivers uses Sourcehut](https://git.sr.ht/~sivers/sive.rs), which I didn't expect.
