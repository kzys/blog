If you know Ron Jeffries, you may be into Agile. I am not. But I know Extreme Programming and he is one of the three founders of Extreme Programming.

He was writing a lot about [Dark Scrum](https://ronjeffries.com/categories/dark-scrum/) from 2015 to 2019. I have read few and they are interesting and thought-provoking. I may not agree with all of them though.

FYI, Dave Thomas has also blogged [Agile is Dead (Long Live Agility)](https://pragdave.me/blog/2014/03/04/time-to-kill-agile.html) in 2014.

> And, unfortunately, I think time has proven me right. The word “agile” has been subverted to the point where it is effectively meaningless, and what passes for an agile community seems to be largely an arena for consultants and vendors to hawk services and products.
