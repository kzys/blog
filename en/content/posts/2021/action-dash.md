In August, [I have written about ActionDash](https://blog.8-p.info/en/2020/08/13/action-dash/);

> I was using ActionDash to limit my time on Chrome and Gmail, but I tended to change the setting to allow a bit of time after hitting the limit, especially regarding Chrome. I have terrible self-control.
>
> So, Iâ€™ve just uninstalled Chrome once again.

Since then,

- [ActionDash has been acquired](https://blog.actionlauncher.com/actiondash-has-been-acquired-d8d86c7b5f4) by [Sensor Tower](https://sensortower.com/about)
- OnePlus 5T got Google's Digital Wellbeing app
- I have uninstalled and installed Chrome and ActionDash a few times

So, here is where I'm at, in terms of reducing my phone usage.

I have both Digital Wellbeing and ActionDash on my OnePlus 5T. I use ActionDash's Focus mode enabled all the time to block Chrome and Gmail. I use Digital Wellbeing's Bedtime mode to gray out my phone from 6pm to 8am.

I have used Digital Wellbeing's Focus mode for a moment, but it was too easy to circumvent and/or disable.
