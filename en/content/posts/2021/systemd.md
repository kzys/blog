[The Tragedy of systemd](https://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/156/)

> systemd is, to put it mildly, controversial. As a FreeBSD developer I decided I wanted to know why.
>
> I delved into the history of bootstrap systems, and even the history of UNIX and other contemporary operating systems, to try and work out why something like systemd was seem as necessary, if not desirable. I also tried to work out why so many people found it so upsetting, annoying, or otherwise rage-inducing.

> Join me on a journey through the bootstrap process, the history of init, the reasons why change can be scary, and the discovery of a part of your OS you may not even know existed.

The word "tragedy" is too clickbaity for this little blog. Anyway, this talk is great.
