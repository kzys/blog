I've been building software for other developers for more than a year now. While this is fun, I feel I've been escaping from asking myself a question. What are the values I'd like to bring to the world?

Building software for other developers, in other words, building tools seems a value-neutral act. Some of us want to believe so. Good folks use computers. Bad folks use computers. We can stop neither of them.

But, is it?

People said, if you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem.

Am I?

No. I wouldn't quit my job to become an activist. But sometimes I think I've been working in a silo, solving tech problems for tech people, remote from the rest of the world.

According to [ZDNet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/moderna-leveraging-its-ai-factory-to-revolutionise-the-way-diseases-are-treated/), Moderna uses AWS, including Fargate.

> Moderna built its own drug design studio, a web-based app hosted on AWS Fargate. 

That makes me feel better :)
