These synthesizers are really cool.

I don't make music. Controlling Adobe Lightroom from a MIDI controller is [apparently a thing](https://rsjaffe.github.io/MIDI2LR/) and some of them [made their controllers](https://lowreal.net/2018/06/19/2). But I don't take photos in RAW.

I have no excuses to buy synthesizers or even MIDI controllers, but they look cool.
