My tech books reading has been mostly on [O'Reilly's app](https://www.oreilly.com/) which I have a discounted subscription through [my ACM membership](https://learning.acm.org/e-learning). I use the app mainly on iPad.

Then some of my friends got e-ink devices like [reMarkable 2](https://remarkable.com/) and [BOOX Note3](https://www.boox.com/note3/). While these large e-ink tablets are too expensive for me, smaller versions are not so. For example, [BOOX Poke3](https://www.boox.com/poke3/) is $189.99, [Bouye Likebook P6](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VH7Q49D) is $149.99 and [Bouye Likebook Mars](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TW1CCCH) is $219.00.

So I did some research before buying one of them.

### Does O'Reilly app support paging instead of scrolling?

I couldn't find the option on the iPad app, but the Android app supports paging, at least on my OnePlus 5T.

### BOOX's bold font issue

Apparently BOOX is rendering text in bold unnecessary on WebViews for more than a year.

* [Text gets bold in third party apps](https://help.boox.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360061548591-Text-gets-bold-in-third-party-apps-)
* [Article text all bold in Note apps](https://www.reddit.com/r/Onyx_Boox/comments/lappwe/article_text_all_bold_in_note_apps/)
* [Onyx Boox bug: All fonts bold in Pocket, Overdrive](http://bbs.onyx-international.com/t/onyx-boox-bug-all-fonts-bold-in-pocket-overdrive/1933/14)

The third link specifically mentions O'Reilly app, that would be a deal-breaker for me.
