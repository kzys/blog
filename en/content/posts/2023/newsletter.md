Because of [Ben Kuhn](https://www.benkuhn.net/writing/) recommended to provide a way to subscribe a blog via email:

> “Doesn’t RSS work for that?” Yes; I and all three other people who still use RSS will be thrilled if you support it! But if you want your ~~boring~~ normal friends to be able to subscribe, you need email too.

And [Chris Krycho](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/please-reply/) said that people would reply to newsletters:

> One of the best things about running a newsletter was that people would reply. It was like the best parts of social media without all the stupidity. Email is great! It’s terrible, too, especially in work contexts… but for this kind of thing, it’s mostly just great.

I decided to use Buttodown as my blogging platform this year, 2023. It has [RSS](https://buttondown.email/kazuyoshi/rss) and [web archive](https://buttondown.email/kazuyoshi/archive) and that's all I need.

[Things I made](https://buttondown.email/kazuyoshi) is the name of the newsletter. I'd like to rename that later though.
