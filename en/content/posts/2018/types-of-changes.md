Compared to React, [Angular's commit message guidelines are very detailed](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines), 

> We have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted. This leads to more readable messages that are easy to follow when looking through the project history. But also, we use the git commit messages to generate the Angular change log.

which are adopted by [Vue's Commit Message Convention](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/.github/COMMIT_CONVENTION.md).

Because of the guidelines, the most of commit messages on the repos start with "types" that indicate the types of changes.

The below chart is the types of changes on Angular over time.
