For next two or three months, I'm going to write a Pomodoro timer app in Swift. I've been using [JustFocus](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/just-focus/id1142151959) as my Pomodoro timer. While I am satisified about 90% of the app, I sometimes forgot to start the timer, mostly after meetings where I tend to cancel an ongoing pomdoro.

Writing Pomodoro timer shouldn't be that hard. I hope that I can "scratch own itch" by writing my own app.

### Having my own project

Another goal of this project is having (and completing) my own software development project.

I've been working as a software developer in a relatively large corp for 5+ years. While working in a large corp itself is fine for me, I recently realized what I conceive as "software development" is becoming "software development within a team, in a large corp" which is just a small sub-set of software development.

So, I want to try something different. [The repos is here](https://github.com/kzys/timer) and I will share my progress in this blog bi-weekly.
