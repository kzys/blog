While Feedly caches a few test posts and I don't know how to delete them,
this is the official first entry of this blog.

I was previously blogging at 2016.8-p.info, 2015.8-p.info, 2014.8-p.info...
This one-blog-per-year experiment allowed me to explore multiple different things:

- 2008 -- Write my own with Perl + [Catalyst](http://www.catalystframework.org/)
- 2009 -- [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/)
- 2010 -- [Tokyo Promenade](http://fallabs.com/tokyopromenade/)
- 2011 -- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
- 2012 -- Write my own with Scala + [Play](https://playframework.com/)
- 2013 -- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
- 2014 -- Write my own with [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)
- 2015 -- [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/)
- 2016 -- [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/)

But I decided to settle down. I joined [mixi, Inc.](http://mixi.co.jp/) back in 2008. The company was a Perl shop. That's why I was writing my own in Perl. Time flies!

So, this blog is generated by Hugo and hosted by Amazon S3. In addition to that, there is Nginx in front of the S3 bucket to enable [HTTP/2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540) and [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).
