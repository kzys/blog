While Feedly caches few test entries and I don't know how to delete them,
this is the official first entry of this blog.
I was previously blogging at 2016.8-p.info, 2015.8-p.info and 2014.8-p.info
and so on. This crazy one-blog-per-year experiment pushed me to try multiple different things --

- 2008: Write my own with Perl + [Catalyst](http://www.catalystframework.org/)
- 2009: [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/)
- 2010: [Tokyo Promenade](http://fallabs.com/tokyopromenade/)
- 2011: [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
- 2012: Write my own with Scala + [Play](https://playframework.com/)
- 2013: [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
- 2014: Write my own with [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)
- 2015: [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/)
- 2016: [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/)

But I decided to settle down. 2008 was the year I joined [mixi, Inc.](http://mixi.co.jp/) out of college and that's why I was writing my own in Perl at that time. What a long journey!

So, this blog is generated by Hugo and hosted by Amazon S3. In addition to that, there is Nginx in front of the S3 bucket to enable [HTTP/2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540) and [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).
