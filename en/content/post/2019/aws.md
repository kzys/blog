I'm going to join Amazon Web Services from next week to work on containers.

I have read Docker in 2013 and [blogged about that in Japanese](http://2013.8-p.info/japanese/06-22-docker.html), then I was [tinkering Docker in 2014](https://github.com/moby/moby/commits?author=kzys) which lost momentum after I moved to the States. So it is interesting to work on containers again.

One of the cool things about the team is that I will primarily work on open source software. I've been contributing open source software for long time. I even have a SourceForge account. But this is first time I do that as a full-time job!
