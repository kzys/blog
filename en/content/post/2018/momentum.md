While I have [another blog in Japanese](https://blog.8-p.info/ja/) where I write about more random thoughts, I wanted to make this blog "themed". It was visualiation from January to Februray, then Rust from July to August, but then I haven't posted for more than two months...

So, I'm going to make this blog less themed to have some momentum going. As Andrew Chen wrote on [10 years of professional blogging – what I’ve learned](https://andrewchen.co/professional-blogging/),

> Nevertheless, because initially no one will read your work, the key is just to get started. Your initial topics and format should be whatever you can do easily and maintain some sort of frequency. Maybe that’s 500 words a month on a new product you’ve tried, and whether you hate or it not. Just get started, find out what you like, and you’ll have a lot of time to figure out the intersection of what you want to write, and what others want to read.

I know that I don't have a lof of readers here. I'm going to write some random but probably tech stuff until the end of this year. See how it goes.
